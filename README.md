trading card centering tool

takes images of (ideally) flatly placed trading cards (such as Pokemon, Magic, or One Piece) and determines how even the centering of card content is from the borders of the card. A 50/50 split horizontally (where the distance from the left border to card content is the exact same as the distance from right border to card content) and vertically (same as before just with the top and bottom borders) is considered a perfectly centered card, and may be extremely sought after and valuable.
